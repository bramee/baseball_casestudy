This is originally about the prediction of wins from 2014 Major League Baseball seasons.

There are 16 different features that will be used as the inputs to the machine learning and the output will be a value that represents the number of wins.

This is a regression problem and have used different algorithms to build the model and trained the train/test data and got the final accuracy which is score of the model.
